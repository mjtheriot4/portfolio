All aesthetic aspects of the redesign were left up to me. The site is totally responsive. I worked closely with a java programmer, to develop a custom back-end experience by leveraging much of the functionality of Jekyll, a static site generator. Jekyll's blog-friendly platform provided much of the foundation for a more custom content management solution.</p>

My responsibilities included implementing this functionality in the back-end, as well as designing a fully responsive, user-friendly web application form. I was also part of a team that designed and implemented a number of changes to visual elements throughout the site.</p>

P5 has a number of useful utilities for reading forms that makes it possible to read and process even very large data sets and output a visualization in the web browser. In this particular case, the data represented is any and all recorded accidents that happened in East Baton Rouge Parish between 2010 and 2016 that include geolocation data. The data is sourced from this <a href="https://data.brla.gov">open data resource.</a></p>

I was responsible for integrating that template into our CMS, creating and replacing content, and generating and modifying layouts to supplement the original skeleton as needed. The final product include a significant amount of totally customized elements, which include animations, inline forms, card-based layouts and a fully responsive video header coded from scratch using the popular Javascript library JQuery.</p>

          <h3>Procedural Photography</h3>
          <i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>
          <p><a class="web" href="https://mjtheriot4.github.io/2210hw13-mjtheriot4/">link</a> The images above were created by utilizing a dataset taken from the color information of each pixel contained in the image associated with each visualization. The first image demonstrates how the color data is represented: the greyscale "Hello World" is composed of letters on a flat black background filled with a constant gradient. The program interprets each pixel in the image and plots its position on a plane of the same dimensions as the original image. The x value of the point corresponds to the x value of the pixel and therefore is not changed. The y value of the point is determined by the value of the pixel's respective RGB intensity values; brighter reds will appear higher on the plane than darker reds, and so on for the greens and blues. Because the first image is in greyscale, each pixel has equal values for red, green and blue, and therefore each scoped color is the same as the others. The other two images show all three channels and just the red channel (respectively) scoped on top of the source image.</p>

          <p>As part of an assignment, I was asked to pick an artist from history and use his or her work as inspiration for a sequence of images to be captured using digital photography.

As such, I processed the digital photograph as if it were a black and white film print, trying to capture some nostalgia in the process.</p>
